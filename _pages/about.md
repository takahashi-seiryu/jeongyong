I am an M.S. student in the
[School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/),
advised by [Prof. SooJean Han](https://soojean.github.io/) in the
[Autonomous Control for Stochastic Systems (ACSS)](http://acss.kaist.ac.kr/).

My research focuses on **safety-critical control and planning under uncertainty** for autonomous and robotic systems. I aim to develop autonomy frameworks that integrate data-driven learning approaches with formal safety guarantees, enabling intelligent systems that are not only high-performing but also provably safe.

In the long term, I seek to combine control-theoretic rigor with learning-based adaptability to advance autonomy toward a future where intelligent systems operate safely in uncertain and dynamic environments. As society steadily transitions to greater automation, I envision contributing to a world where safety is not compromised by autonomyâ€”a future beyond the accident-prone era of human-driven machines, toward truly dependable intelligent systems.
