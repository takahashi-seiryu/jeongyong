I am an M.S. student in the 
[School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/), 
advised by [Prof. SooJean Han](https://soojean.github.io/) in the 
[Autonomous Control for Stochastic Systems (ACSS)](http://acss.kaist.ac.kr/).

My research focuses on **safety-critical system and control**, 
with applications to robotics. 
I am particularly interested in developing methods for **safe control of stochastic systems** 
and **uncertainty-aware motion planning** for autonomous robots.

My long-term goal is to establish an autonomy framework that **unifies learning with formal guarantees**, 
so that our systems are not only performant but also provably safe.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
